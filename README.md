## Features

- Supports account creation and login.
- Users can add words indivually or by adding blocks of text in their target language.
- When inputting target content, Pyxis will identify any new words and prompt the user to add them to the flashcard decks.

- Words may optionally be added as ignores (names, filler words, etc.) or variants (different conjugations or declensions) to reduce duplicate flashcards while maintaining accurate stats on target blocks.
- Easily manage all flashcards, ignores, and variants.
- Flaskcards using spaced repetition automatically assign the next review date based on user's familiarity with words over time.
